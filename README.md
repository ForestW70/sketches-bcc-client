* # Description:
    Front-end web application that uses an HTML audio player and client-side javaScript to create a light-weight iTunes style app to play local mp3 files.

    Use this page to listen to some of my WIP songs, as well as my new album, sketches bcc. 

* ## Usage:
    1. Scroll through each section to click and choose which song to play next.

    2. Once you have chosen the song, press play in audio player to listen. Audio player also allows user to change song tempo, as well as download tracks they enjoy (dont forget to come follow on soundcloud ;))

    3. While song is playing you may click more songs to add to a "queue", and when you are ready to move onto the next song, you may click "next track" and it will load the next song into the player. 

* ### Project Notes: 
    This is the first draft of a client-side-only version, with only vital functionallity implemented. The second draft will include more advanced features such as a server/back-end as well as a SQL database. Draft three will be writen using the React framework and include more bells and whistles.

    * ##### Current Features:
        - View and play over 80 songs.
        - Add songs to queue, as well as modify queue.
        - Sort song list in both directions for column heads of different criteria.
        - Modify song playback speed.
        - Song Download.

    * ##### Features yet to add:
        - refactor code to be uniform (eslint)
